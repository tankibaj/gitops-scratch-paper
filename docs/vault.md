# Vault by HashiCorp
Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ../applications/vault.yaml
```
---
## Initialize Vault

- Display all the pods within the `vault` namespace

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault get pods
    ```

- Initialize vault-0 with one key share and one key threshold.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault exec vault-0 -- vault operator init \
        -key-shares=1 \
        -key-threshold=1 \
        -format=json > vault-keys.json
    ```

  The `[operator init](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/operator/init)` command generates a root key that it disassembles into key shares `-key-shares=1` and then sets the number of key shares required to unseal Vault `-key-threshold=1`. These key shares are written to the output as unseal keys in JSON format `-format=json`. Here the output is redirected to a file named `cluster-keys.json`.

- Display the unseal key found in `vault-keys.json`.

    ```bash
    jq -r ".unseal_keys_b64[]" vault-keys.json
    ```

  **Insecure operation:** Do not run an unsealed Vault in production with a single key share and a single key threshold. This approach is only used here to simplify the unsealing process for this demonstration.

- Create a variable named `VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY` to capture the Vault unseal key.

    ```bash
    VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY=$(jq -r ".unseal_keys_b64[]" vault-keys.json)
    ```

  After initialization, Vault is configured to know where and how to access the storage, but does not know how to decrypt any of it. [Unsealing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/seal#unsealing) is the process of constructing the root key necessary to read the decryption key to decrypt the data, allowing access to the Vault.

- Unseal Vault running on the `vault-0` pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault exec vault-0 -- vault operator unseal $VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY
    ```

  **Insecure operation:** Providing the unseal key with the command writes the key to your shellâ€™s history. This approach is only used here to simplify the unsealing process for this demonstration.

  The `operator unseal` command reports that Vault is initialized and unsealed.

  **Example output:**

    ```
    Key             Value
    ---             -----
    Seal Type       shamir
    Initialized     true

    Total Shares    1
    Threshold       1
    Version         1.12.1
    Build Date      2022-10-27T12:32:05Z
    Storage Type    consul
    Cluster Name    vault-cluster-d6d53090
    Cluster ID      4b8727be-c2f0-2400-c92e-d2a730cfaec7
    HA Enabled      true
    HA Cluster      https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201
    HA Mode         active
    Active Since    2023-02-19T05:40:07.135944348Z
    ```

  The Vault server is initialized and unsealed.

- Unseal Vault running on the `vault-1` pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault exec vault-1 -- vault operator unseal $VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY
    ```

- Unseal Vault running on the `vault-2` pod.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault exec vault-2 -- vault operator unseal $VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY
    ```

- Verify all the Vault pods are running and ready.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n vault get pods
    ```

  Example output:

    ```
    NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    vault-0                                 1/1     Running   0          5m49s
    vault-1                                 1/1     Running   0          5m48s
    vault-2                                 1/1     Running   0          5m47s
    vault-agent-injector-5945fb98b5-vzbqv   1/1     Running   0          5m50s
    ```

## Vault CLI client

### Root Token

- Set environment variables. This will configure the Vault client to talk to the vault server.

    ```bash
    export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.local.naim.run
    ```

- Create a variable named `VAULT_ROOT_KEY` to capture the Vault root token and endpoint.

    ```bash
    VAULT_ROOT_KEY=$(cat vault-keys.json | jq -r ".root_token")
    ```

- Vault is now ready for you. Lets check vault status:

    ```bash
    vault status
    ```


### User Token

- Set environment variables. This will configure the Vault client to talk to the vault server.

    ```bash
    export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.local.naim.run
    ```

- To interact with Vault, you must provide a valid token. Setting this environment variable is a way to provide the token to Vault via CLI.

    ```bash
    export VAULT_TOKEN="hvs.6j4cuewowBGit65rheNoceI7"
    ```

- Authenticate with Vault

    ```bash
    vault login
    ```

## Secrets Engines

Secrets engines are Vault components which store, generate or encrypt secrets.

### Enable a secrets engine

To get started, enable a new KV secrets engine at the path `secret`. Each path is completely isolated and cannot talk to other paths. For example, a KV secrets engine enabled at `foo` has no ability to communicate with a KV secrets engine enabled at `bar`.

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2
```

To verify our success and get more information about the secrets engine, use the `vault secrets list` command:

```bash
vault secrets list
```

**Output**

```
Path          Type         Accessor              Description
----          ----         --------              -----------
cubbyhole/    cubbyhole    cubbyhole_245571c4    per-token private secret storage
identity/     identity     identity_6c094184     identity store
kv/           kv           kv_e5b3a51e           n/a
secret/       kv           kv_9b6a980c           n/a
sys/          system       system_f45198e2       system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging
```

### Create a secret

- Create a secret at path `secret/webapp/config` with a `username` and `password`.

    ```bash
    vault kv put secret/webapp/config username="static-user" password="static-password"
    ```

  **Output**

    ```
    ====== Secret Path ======
    secret/data/webapp/config
    
    ======= Metadata =======
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    created_time       2023-02-20T23:14:58.455587859Z
    custom_metadata    <nil>
    deletion_time      n/a
    destroyed          false
    version            1
    ```

- Verify that the secret is defined at the path `secret/webapp/config`.

    ```bash
    vault kv get secret/webapp/config
    ```

  **Output**

    ```
    ====== Secret Path ======
    secret/data/webapp/config
    
    ======= Metadata =======
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    created_time       2023-02-20T23:14:58.455587859Z
    custom_metadata    <nil>
    deletion_time      n/a
    destroyed          false
    version            1
    
    ====== Data ======
    Key         Value
    ---         -----
    password    static-password
    username    static-user
    ```
