- Fetch crds.yaml and olm.yaml manifests from the github repository
- Remove namespace resources from the OLM manifests to avoid conflicts with the gitops
- Split up manifests into separate files for easier management
- Add sync-wave and hook annotations to ensure that the CRDs are created before the operator
- Add a `kustomization.yaml` file to make it easier to deploy the manifests
